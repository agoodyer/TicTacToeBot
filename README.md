## ✨ Key Features

* **📡 Low-Latency Wireless Control:** Utilizes dual ESP32 modules for high-speed Wi-Fi communication, ensuring near-instant response times between the controller and the bot.
* **🔄 Tank-Turn Maneuverability:** Features a dedicated **SPIN button** that reverses one motor while driving the other, enabling rapid 360-degree rotation in place.
* **🏗️ Precision Lever System:** Includes a 9-gram servo-controlled lever designed for long reach and end-point rotation to interact with game elements.
* **⚡ Speed-Optimized Design:** Purposefully minimalist, being the smallest and lightest bot in the competition to maximize acceleration and nimbly traverse the course.
* **🛠️ Fault-Tolerant Firmware:** Modular C++ code architecture designed for high-frequency polling and reduced signal interference.

## 🛠️ System Architecture

1.  **Low-Latency Polling:** The controller polls 7 hardware buttons at high frequency to capture directional and utility inputs.
2.  **Wireless Handshake:** Facilitates real-time communication via ESP32 Wi-Fi protocols to minimize physical tethering.
3.  **3-Point Contact:** The mechanical base utilizes two drive wheels and a single ball-bearing wheel for efficient rotation and stability.
4.  **Modular Codebase:** The software separates motor control, wireless communication, and lever actuation for ease of maintenance and debugging.
